# Data transformation

```{r}
NY_Jan_cleaning <- NY_Jan[,-32]
NY_Jan_cleaning = filter(NY_Jan_cleaning, is.na(NY_Jan_cleaning$AIR_TIME) == FALSE)
```

According to the result of missing pattern plotting, we would like to clean the worthless column `x`, and also those incomplete data points, which has some delay-irrelevant features being NA values.
