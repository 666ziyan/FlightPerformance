"],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Above is a plot of missing patterns and count of missing values. We can see that the variable x is missing in all rows, so we can remove it from our dataset. Further, more than 90% of data follows the top missing pattern as shown in the plot. The variables CARRIER_DELAY, LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, NAS_DELAY, SECURITY_DELAY and WEATHER_DELAY are missing in this pattern, indicating that these flights did not delay. In the second most frequent missing pattern, these variables have non-NA values. It implies that the flight was delayed and the delay time due to these reasons are shown in the dataset. The bottom three missing patterns are much less frequent than the other two. The missing values in ARR_TIME, DEP_TIME cause the missing in ARR_DELAY and DEP_DELAY respectively, and it may be caused by cancellation of flights, or may be caused by errors in the data collection. Fortunately, such incomplete samples only take up a small proportion, thus having little effect on data analysis. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results Among all the carriers that provide commercial services in U.S., are there any carriers that have major delay problems? For example, the average delay time is over 60 minutes. The dataframe NY_Jan_delayCount shows the number of delays for each carrier within the January. We plot a simple bar graph to manifest the result more explicitly. Note that this figure only shows the number of times that the delay occurs, on the other side, we need to evaluate the averaged severity of the delays, i.e. the averaged time of the delays for each carrier. Moreover, we hope to explore the results for concrete delay reasons, i.e. CARRIER_DELAY, WEATHER_DELAY, NAS_DELAY, SECURITY_DELAY and LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, PROBLEM TWO: PROBLEM THREE "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
