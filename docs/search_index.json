Ziyan Liu is in charge of pulling the datasets down from the website. Since we want to analyze flight delays, we select the “Aviation” mode in the data finder, find the database called “Airline On-Time Performance Data”, and download tables from “Marketing Carrier On-Time Performance (Beginning January 2018)” (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGK&amp;QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr). It is nice that the website provides field selection feature, and we select 29 variables that we find useful in our project to include in the datasets. These variables include information about airline carriers, origins, destinations, departure and arrival time and delay situations of U.S. domestic flights. We download 24 tables in total, each containing flight information during one month from January 2019 to December 2020. ‘YEAR’, ‘DAY_OF_WEEK’, ‘FL_DATE’ are the three variables that indicate the date of flights. ‘MKT_CARRIER_AIRLINE_ID’ is the identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airline (carrier). ‘ORIGIN’, ‘ORIGIN_CITY_NAME’, ‘ORIGIN_STATE_ABR’ are the abbreviation of origin airport, origin city name, and the abbreviation of origin state. ‘DEST’, ‘DEST_CITY_NAME’, ‘DEST_STATE_ABR’ contain information similarly for the destination. ‘CRS_DEP_TIME’ is the CRS departure time of flight, ‘DEP_TIME’ is the actual departure time, ‘DEP_DELAY’ is the departure delay time in minutes, where negative numbers indicate early departure, and ‘DEP_DELAY_NEW’ is the same with ‘DEP_DELAY’ except negative numbers are replaced by 0. Arrival information are encoded in the ‘ARR’ variables similarly. ‘CANCELLED’ indicates if the flight is cancelled, where 1 means it is, and ‘CANCELLATION_CODE’ specifies reasons for cancellation. ‘CRS_ELAPSED_TIME’ is the estimated elapsed time of flight in minutes, ‘ACTUAL_ELAPSED_TIME’ is the actual time, and ‘AIR_TIME’ is the flight time. ‘DISTANCE’ gives the distance between airports in miles. Lastly, ‘CARRIER_DELAY’, ‘WEATHER_DELAY’, ‘NAS_DELAY’, ‘SECURITY_DELAY’ and ‘LLATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY’ are the causes of delay in minutes. The datasets before March 2020 contain about 650,000 records per month, and there is a significant drop after March 2020, obviously due to the pandemic, where each contains about 350,000 records. In total, there are 8,066,815 and 5,022,397 records of U.S. domestic flights respectively in 2019 and 2020. The datasets contain very detailed information and statistics. We found that, however, there are flights that did not fly and are NA’s in the tables, and that some flights are delayed, but no specific reasons are given. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The downloaded monthly data are stored in csv files, so we simply read the data with R function read.csv and store them in respective variables. Then we combine them by year using rbind function in variables US_2019 and US_2020. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Above is a plot of missing patterns and count of missing values. We can see that the variable x is missing in all rows, so we can remove it from our dataset. Further, approximately 80% of data follows the top missing pattern as shown in the plot. The variables CARRIER_DELAY, LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, NAS_DELAY, SECURITY_DELAY and WEATHER_DELAY are missing in this pattern, indicating that these flights did not have a delay reason. In the second most frequent missing pattern, these variables have non-NA values. It implies that the flight was delayed and the delay time due to these reasons are shown in the dataset. The bottom four missing patterns are much less frequent than the top two. The missing values in ARR_TIME, DEP_TIME cause the missing in ARR_DELAY and DEP_DELAY respectively, and it may be caused by cancellation of flights, or may be caused by errors in the data collection. Fortunately, such incomplete samples only take up a small proportion, thus having little effect on data analysis. According to the result of missing pattern plotting, we would like to clean the worthless column x, and also those incomplete data points, which has some delay-irrelevant features being NA values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results 5.0.1 Compare Carriers’ On-Time Performance As we can see from the figure below, Delta Air Lines Inc. have over 3,000 flights delayed during January 2019 from and to New York state, American Airlines Inc. also have more than 2,000 flights delayed, and the number is approximately 1.200 for JetBlue Airways. This is justifiable since these are the major airlines that conduct the most domestic flights, and the number of delayed flights, certainly, increases as the number of total conducted flights increases. Note that this figure only shows the number of times that delay occurs. On the other side, we need to evaluate the average severity of the delays, i.e. the average time of the delays for each carrier. Therefore, we make another bar plot manifesting the average delay time for each carrier airline. Using the same dataset as above (flights from and to New York state during January 2019), we can see that United Air Lines Inc have the longest average delay time of 104.83 minutes. Hawaiian Airlines Inc., Spirit Air Lines, Delta Air Lines Inc., JetBlue Airways, American Airlines Inc. and Frontier Airlines Inc. all have average delay time longer than an hour. Moreover, we hope to explore the results for concrete delay reasons, i.e. CARRIER_DELAY, WEATHER_DELAY, NAS_DELAY, SECURITY_DELAY and LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY. For each reason, we make two figures showing the count of delays and average delay time with respect to each carrier. From the figures, we can find that the most common and severe reason causing flight delays is LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, which presumably can be due to the late arrival or preceding flights. There are almost 2,000 Delta Air Lines Inc. flights are delayed due to this reason, and the average waiting time exceeds 2 hours for Hawaiian Airlines Inc. flights. The second most common reason is NAS_DELAY, i.e., national air system delay, but the average time caused by this is typically not as long as that caused by other reasons, mostly within an hour. CARRIER_DELAY is the third most common reason that causes delays. This happens a lot of times for Delta Air Lines Inc., JetBlue Airways, and American Airlines Inc.. On average, when this happens, the waiting time for United Air Lines Inc. flights is over 100 minutes. WEATHER_DELAY is less frequent than the three above. Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Inc. have about 150 delays caused by weather, which is a very small proportion of all delays. However, the time is highly variable- the longest is 118 minutes for Delta Air Lines Inc., and the shortest is only 12.5 minutes. Among all 5 reasons, SECURITY_DELAY is the rarest, and only occurs 15 times. Therefore, we do not discuss this reason in detail. 5.0.2 On-Time Performance Accross the Day In addition to comparing the differences among the various airlines, we also compared the on-time performance of flights at difference time of a day. We divide the 24 hours of a day into 8 groups, one group every three hours, and calculated the average delay time of departure and arrival. As we can see in the plot below, flight performance of 2020 is obviously better than in 2019. The green horizontal line at level 0 indicates the flight delays or not. Specifically, flights in 2020 almost arrive in advance to their destination no matter they departs lately or not. Unfortunately, flights in 2019 almost depart lately. Moreover, late flights seem to performance worse than early flights in general. The plot shows the performance of flights from NY to other states within US. Almost all subgraphs indicate similar conclusions in the previous picture, i.e. flight performance of 2020 is obviously better than in 2019, and also late flights seem to performance worse than early flights. Note that flights to some destinations e.g. HI, MT, NM, are only provided in certain periods, which may caused by the distance and passenger volume. ## [1] &quot;12&quot; &quot;03&quot; &quot;06&quot; &quot;09&quot; &quot;01&quot; &quot;04&quot; &quot;07&quot; &quot;10&quot; &quot;02&quot; &quot;05&quot; &quot;08&quot; &quot;11&quot; The plot above shows flights performance in each months, which also yields the two conclusions mentioned berofe. Moreover, some other interesting observations are: (1) Note that in winter (Dec, Jan, Feb), flight performance is in general worse than in other seasons, especially for those late flights, which may due to the cold weather. (2) Season Fall seems to have the best flight performance. 3D plot is more powerful to show the variation of a quantity grouped by multi-indexes. PROBLEM THREE: Specifically for NYC. If someone wants to come to NYC, which airport should s/he choose to fly to based on the origin city?
