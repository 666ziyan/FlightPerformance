We can see that the variable x is missing in all rows, so we can remove it from our dataset. Further, more than 90% of data follows the top missing pattern as shown in the plot. The variables CARRIER_DELAY, LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, NAS_DELAY, SECURITY_DELAY and WEATHER_DELAY are missing in this pattern, indicating that these flights did not delay. In the second most frequent missing pattern, these variables have non-NA values. It implies that the flight was delayed and the delay time due to these reasons are shown in the dataset. The bottom three missing patterns are much less frequent than the other two. The missing values in ARR_TIME, DEP_TIME cause the missing in ARR_DELAY and DEP_DELAY respectively, and it may be caused by cancellation of flights.
